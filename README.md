## 📖 Introduction
This notebook aims to analyze the relationships between different physical attributes of penguins, such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass as well as using the exisiting attributes to create new features applying the concept of Feature engineering 

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing
The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and convert data types as necessary.
This includes:
- Selecting numeric columns for analysis.
- Handling any missing values.
- Data Type Conversion
- Feature Engineering
  
## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, various statistical methods and visualizations are used to explore the dataset, 
including:
- Summary statistics
- Histograms and density plots

## 📊 Visualization
This section involves creating visual representations of the data to better understand the distributions and relationships. 
Key visualizations include:
- Scatter plots
- Pair plots
- Heatmaps

## 📈 Correlation Analysis
A detailed correlation analysis is performed to understand the relationships between different variables. The analysis includes:
- Calculating the correlation matrix
- Visualizing the correlation matrix using a heatmap
- Identifying strong correlations between variables


## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run each cell sequentially to perform the analysis.
3. Ensure that all dependencies are installed in the Colab environment.
